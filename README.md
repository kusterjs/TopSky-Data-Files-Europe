# TopSky-Data-Files-Europe
An initiative to share TopSky Data Files across FIRs/vACCs

This repo is to collect, organise and maintain TopSky Data Files (primarily areas) for FIRs/vACCs in Europe. For this purpose, the structure follows the different Data Files used by the TopSky plugin.

## Areas
The areas are structured by country code (first two letters of the FIR). An additional file contains the cross border areas (CBA).
